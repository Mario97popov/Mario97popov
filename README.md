# 👋 Hey, I'm a Data Engineer in Progress 🚀

Welcome to my GitHub!  
I’m working **daily** with production-style tools to sharpen my skills and build strong data intuition.

---

📆 **One task every day. No zero days.**

My focus stack:
- 🐍 **Python** – data processing, orchestration logic
- 🌬️ **Apache Airflow** – scheduling, orchestration, monitoring
- 🗄️ **PostgreSQL** – data modeling, analytics, performance tuning
- ☁️ **Amazon S3** – data lake storage & partitioning

> Building boring, reliable data systems — the kind companies actually need.
